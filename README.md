Problem Statement- We have to create a solution for customers so that they can post the job openings.

Solution- We have created a CRM for companies so that they can post job openings in simple steps:
1) Login to the page (Do sign up first, if not registered yet)
2) Go to the job opening section 
3) It will open a form with required specifications
4) Submit the data. On submitting the data, data will be post to the job API which we have created and we can display the details using /jobs route.
5) After posting the job opening, log out from the job section.
